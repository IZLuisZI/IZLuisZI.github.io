# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). This README will guide you through the process of how I created this project.

## Idea

The idea was to create a portfolio that showcases my projects and challenges. Each project has a brief description, a link to the live version, a link to the source code on GitHub, and tags indicating the main technologies used.

## Technologies

The website is built with Astro and uses various technologies for different projects, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io, and Node.js.

## Development Process

1. **Design**: I started by designing the layout of the portfolio. I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create the design.

2. **Astro Setup**: After the design was ready, I set up the Astro project. I used the Astro CLI to create a new project.

3. **Component Creation**: I then created the necessary Astro components for the portfolio. These components include the project cards, the header, and the footer.

4. **Styling**: For styling, I used Tailwind CSS. I configured Tailwind in the Astro project and then used it to style the components.

5. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed the portfolio here in Github.

## Challenges

I faced a few challenges during the development of this portfolio. For example, I had to learn how to use Astro, which was a new technology for me. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by reading the Astro documentation and asking for help on the Astro Discord server.

## Conclusion

Creating this portfolio was a great learning experience for me. I was able to learn a new technology (Astro) and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
